## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tomasmach/pomodoro-timer.git
    cd pomodoro-script
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable**
    You need to give the script permission to run.
    ```sh
    chmod +x pomodoro
    ```

3.  **Create a symbolic link**
    To make the `pomodoro` command available system-wide, we'll link it to `~/.local/bin`.
    ```sh
    # Ensure the target directory exists
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

    # Create the link
    ln -s "$(pwd)/pomodoro" ~/.local/bin/pomodoro
    ```
    Now you can call `pomodoro` from anywhere!
